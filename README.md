# Algorand DApp Dashboard with A-Frame

Welcome to the Algorand DApp Dashboard project! This project was developed as part of the coursework for CSC 545, where we explored decentralized applications (DApps) and virtual reality interfaces. The dashboard provides a real-time interface to view Algorand live transactions in a virtual 3D space using A-Frame.

## Project Overview

This dashboard is designed to visualize Algorand blockchain transactions in a unique and immersive way. By leveraging the power of A-Frame, users can interact with a 3D environment that presents live transaction data from the Algorand network.

## Features

- **Real-time Transaction Data:** The dashboard connects to the Algorand blockchain to display live transaction information.
- **Virtual Reality Interface:** Using A-Frame, the transactions are visualized in a 3D space, allowing for an immersive experience.
- **Intuitive Design:** The dashboard provides an easy-to-navigate interface, making it accessible even for users new to blockchain technology.

## Deployment

This project is deployed and accessible via [Glitch](https://jet-snow-spectacles.glitch.me).

## Technologies Used

- **Algorand Blockchain:** The backbone of the decentralized application, providing real-time transaction data.
- **A-Frame:** A powerful framework for building virtual reality (VR) experiences on the web.
- **JavaScript:** For handling data connections and rendering the interface.

## Coursework

This project was part of the coursework for CSC 545. The primary goal was to integrate blockchain technology with virtual reality to create an innovative dashboard for monitoring decentralized applications. By using A-Frame, we explored new ways of visualizing data and enhancing user interaction with blockchain networks.

## How to Use

1. Visit the deployed project [here](https://jet-snow-spectacles.glitch.me).
2. Navigate through the 3D environment to explore live Algorand transactions.
3. Use standard VR controls to interact with the dashboard.

## Future Enhancements

- **Expanded VR Capabilities:** We plan to integrate more advanced VR controls for enhanced interaction.
- **Additional Blockchain Support:** Expanding the dashboard to support other blockchain networks beyond Algorand.
- **Customizable Views:** Allow users to personalize the data and the way it is presented in the 3D space.
